Benassi
*******
Benassi is a Django model setup for the sending and storing of Push messages on the iOS platform. It is ins active developement, but should be a good foundation for someone who wishes to stop paying for a third party PUSH service that uses APNS. The storage is backend agnostic as well as the code. All written using the Python standard library 2.6.x+.
